## How to Build and Run

To compile and run the algorithms, follow these general steps:

1. Navigate to the folder of the specific algorithm or data structure you want to build.

2. Locate the `build.sh` file in the folder.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt.

4. Run the `build.sh` script by executing the following command:

5. If the build is successful, an executable file (e.g., `test`) will be generated in the same folder.

6. To run the executable, use the following command:

7. Follow any on-screen instructions or input requirements specific to the algorithm.

Note: Ensure you have a C compiler (e.g., GCC) installed on your system before attempting to build the code. You may need to install development tools or libraries depending on the algorithm's requirements.

Feel free to refer to the individual algorithm folders for more detailed build and usage instructions.
